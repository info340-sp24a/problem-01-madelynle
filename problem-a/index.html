        <h1>Kuromi: The White Rabbit Jester</h1>

        <p>
            <p></p><a href="https://hellokitty.fandom.com/wiki/Kuromi">Kuromi (クロミ, Kuromi)</a> 
            is a character from the My Melody universe. She is My Melody's rival, and manifests as 
            a white rabbit or imp-like creature wearing a black jester's hat with a pink skull on 
            the front and a black devil's tail. The skull's facial expression changes to match Kuromi's 
            mood. Fittingly, her birthday is Halloween (October 31st). Her name translates from Japanese 
            to English as "black beauty".</p>
