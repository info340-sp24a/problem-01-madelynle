        <h1>Kuromi: The White Rabbit Jester</h1>
        <p><a href="https://hellokitty.fandom.com/wiki/Kuromi">Kuromi (クロミ, Kuromi)</a> is a character from the My Melody universe. She is My Melody's rival, and manifests as a white rabbit or imp-like creature wearing a black jester's hat with a pink skull on the front and a black devil's tail. The skull's facial expression changes to match Kuromi's mood. Fittingly, her birthday is Halloween (October 31st). Her name translates from Japanese to English as "black beauty".</p>
